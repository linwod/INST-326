This week I used AI mainly outside of academic settings, mainly for internships. For large companies with many openings, I inputted my resume and links to the attached openings, and then tailored bullet points on my resume to specific responsibilities or skills on the job posting. Using AI, I also had it order the jobs I was most suited/qualified for.

In terms of academics, I used AI working through some of exercises, breaking down complex problems on a step-by-step basis so that problems were more manageable to complete.

Week 7 AI Journal Entry

This week I used AI relatively heavily. In comparison to previous weeks, there has been a lot of projects and groupwork due this week, both in this class and out. Regarding Project 2, it was definitely easier to manage than Project 1. Unfortunately, one of my groupmates was sick, so I used AI to breakdown some of his work to make it more understandable to me (not my subject area of the UI/UX portion of the project). With this, I hope to make impactful edits with my work and try to understand my groupmate's part of the project.

With the weekly exercises, I also found them relatively confusing. ChatGPT was very useful at breaking down problems for me to digest and approach.
